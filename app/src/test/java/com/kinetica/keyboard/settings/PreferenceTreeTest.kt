/**
 * The shape of the settings tree, read off the shipped XML.
 *
 * The screen was one flat list of 52 rows until a user said it could not be navigated. It is
 * five nested screens now, and nesting has one way to fail hard: `android:dependency` is
 * resolved against the CURRENT root, and each subscreen is inflated as its own root, so a
 * dependent separated from its parent throws at inflation rather than degrading. That is
 * what [everyDependencyLivesWithItsParent] is for, and it is the reason this file exists.
 *
 * Parsed as text rather than with a real XML parser for the same reason
 * `SymbolsLayoutTest` matches strings: the question is about structure, and the file is read
 * straight off disk so Gradle does not treat it as an input. **`--rerun-tasks` is what makes
 * a fail-first check here actually run.**
