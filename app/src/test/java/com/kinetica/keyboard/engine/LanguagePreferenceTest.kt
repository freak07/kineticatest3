/**
 * Cross-language candidate ranking (`WordComposer.merge`), pinned with the
 * exact candidate tuples captured on device.
 *
 * Dictionary-free on purpose (the StartSubtreeFairnessTest precedent): what is
 * under test is which candidate of which list may lead, so the regression must
 * be locked to that mechanism and not to a wordlist snapshot that a future
 * asset regeneration would shift out from under it. The real-asset end-to-end
 * behavior lives in LanguageDetectGoldenTest.
 *
 * Rewritten when the merged ranking replaced the swap. This class used to test
 * `preferAlternate`, a whole-list swap gated by LANG_DETECT_LOW_CONF and
 * LANG_DETECT_MARGIN. Measurement took that gate to its design limit - the
 * same-language and foreign confidence-ratio populations overlap in
 * [1.000, 1.095] on real geometry, so no threshold separates them, and a wrong
 * swap discarded the active language's candidates entirely. Both languages now
 * rank into ONE list. Every case below keeps its original evidence and comment;
 * the assertion changes from "does the swap fire" to "which candidate leads,
 * and is the other language still reachable in the bar".
 *
 * Two cases invert deliberately, each with its reason on the test:
 * [aForeignFitPastTheCapCannotLeadEvenWhenItsListHoldsABetterOne] and
 * [aHopelessForeignFitCannotLead] (the last half of the hopeless-decode
 * defect, which the merged ranking closes).
