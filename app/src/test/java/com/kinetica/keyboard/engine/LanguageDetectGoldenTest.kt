/**
 * Cross-language ranking against the real bundled it/es assets, with Italian
 * active - the configuration in which three swipe words committed in Spanish.
 *
 * The failing buffers are rebuilt from the `keys=` contact letters the trace
 * prints, which is what that field was added for: a captured gesture is
 * reconstructible as a fixture. The reconstruction is a polyline through those
 * contacts' key centers, so distances differ from the device's by a few
 * hundredths - the mechanism, not the exact number, is what these lock. The
 * device's own candidate tuples are pinned separately and dictionary-free in
 * LanguagePreferenceTest.
 *
 * Rewritten when the whole-list swap became one ranked
 * list. The question each case asks is unchanged - would this gesture hand the
 * editor to the wrong language - but it is now asked of the merged list's lead
 * rather than of a swap decision, and the losing language stays pickable
 * instead of being discarded.
