/**
 * A frequent, context-boosted or personally reinforced word with mediocre
 * shape used to outrank a near-perfect geometric
 * fit, because `1/(1+d)` varies only 1.0 -> 0.4 across the useful distance
 * range while `fw * bm * pb` spans ~3x.
 *
 * Every case here is a real device contest from the DecodeTrace captures,
 * rebuilt from the `keys=` contact letters as a polyline through those key
 * centres - the reconstruction LanguageDetectGoldenTest introduced. Two things
 * make these fixtures faithful that a plain swipe fixture is not:
 *
 *  - the captured `ctx=` is replayed, so the bigram multiplier that decided the
 *    contest is present (the quindi->state boost, she->the, he->her);
 *  - the personal commit counts are SYNTHESISED from the boost the trace
 *    implies (count = exp((pb-1)/PERSONAL_BOOST) - 1, where
 *    pb = s*(1+d)/(fw*bm)). Three of these rows were decided by personal
 *    reinforcement the JVM has no other way to see - "come" at pb 1.59 and
 *    "sei" at 1.49 beat their rivals on that alone.
 *
 * The counts are approximate by construction (the trace prints 2 decimals, and
 * pb is exponential in the count), so they are chosen to reproduce the observed
 * ORDER, which they do; they are not claims about any real dictionary.
