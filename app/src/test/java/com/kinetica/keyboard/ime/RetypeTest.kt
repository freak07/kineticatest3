 * What a retype throws away.

 * Pure for the reason the rest of this package's rules are: the service has no JVM reach.
 * The behaviour around it - the delete, the abandon, the cursor - is one call each and is
 * on the device checklist; what is decided here is the span, which is the part that can be
