/**
 * No class-level property may be declared below its own `init` block.
 *
 * Kotlin runs property initializers and `init` blocks in DECLARATION order, so a property
 * written below `init` is still null while `init` runs. Anything `init` calls that reads it
 * throws out of the constructor, and for a view built on the key-handling path that means
 * the keyboard dies rather than the feature failing: `EmojiPickerView.glyphPaint` sat eleven
 * lines too low and the emoji panel took the whole IME down with it. KNOWN_ISSUES item 64.
 *
 * Reads the source off disk, the same way [com.kinetica.keyboard.ui.EmojiDataTest] and
 * [com.kinetica.keyboard.settings.PreferenceTreeTest] read the assets, so **`--rerun-tasks`
 * is what makes a fail-first check here actually run.**
 *
 * **This is a heuristic and the escape is deliberate.** A property never touched from `init`
 * is safe anywhere, so a future case may trip this for real. The fix is to move the property
 * above `init` or to make it a function, which has no ordering problem at all. Relaxing the
 * test instead needs a stated reason, because what it prevents is a dead keyboard.
