/**
 * Suggestion strip: one row of equal-width zones, each an independently tappable full
 * candidate word. How many share a row is [BarZones]' answer, from the words' own
 * measured widths up to [MAX_ZONES], so long candidates get the room rather than an
 * ellipsis. Candidates beyond one row live on further pages: a horizontal drag anywhere
 * across the words cycles pages in either direction, with position dots at the bottom
 * center while more than one page exists. The same layout serves both phases of a
 * word's life:
 *
 *  - composition mode: ranked candidates for the word in progress, best first
 *    (bold); tapping a zone commits that word, a fast upward flick commits
 *    without waiting for the tap to settle;
 *  - correction mode (after a commit): the committed word (highlighted chip)
 *    plus the alternatives it beat; tapping any other zone replaces the last
 *    committed word in the editor directly.
 *
 * Long-pressing any zone in either mode arms weight adjustment without
 * committing: sliding up while held increases the personal weight, sliding down
 * decreases it, one increment per REINFORCE_STEP_DP of travel, with the tier badge
 * previewing the pending level live. The delta is applied only on lift.
 *
 * Releasing in place reinforces the word in composition mode, as a plain long-press
 * always did. In correction mode it picks instead: there the tap is the primary action
 * and a deliberate one is slow, so the arm was stealing the gesture the strip exists for.
