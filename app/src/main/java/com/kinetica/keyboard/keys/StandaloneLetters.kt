/**
 * Which single letters are words on their own, per language.
 *
 * A curated list rather than a dictionary test, and the dictionary is exactly why. **Every
 * letter a-z is an entry in every bundled wordlist**, with frequencies large enough to look
 * deliberate: `en` holds `l` at 126 518, `s` at 110 199, `t` at 72 881, `d` at 64 304. They
 * are OpenSubtitles artefacts - split contractions, initials, list markers - so
 * `WordPredictor.isWord` answers yes for a lone `t` and no dictionary rule can separate
 * that from a lone `a`.
 *
 * Kept beside [AutoCapitalization] because it is the same kind of fact and takes the same
 * argument: the LANGUAGE decides, not the position. `e` is a word in Italian and not in
 * English; `y` is one in Spanish and not anywhere else here.
 *
 * [lang] is the ACTIVE language code, matching [AutoCapitalization.forWord]. The known cost
 * of that choice: with per-word auto-detect on, typing Italian while English is active gets
 * the English set, so an Italian `e` will not space. Widening to a union of the enabled
 * languages was rejected for the same reason the capitalization rule rejects it - it would
 * import each language's risk into the others, and a wrong fire costs a space the user has
 * to delete.
 *
 * Why this list is safe to spend a premature space on is [autospacesTappedWord]'s business,
 * and the answer is the delay: one letter is weaker evidence than a word, so it waits
 * longer. KNOWN_ISSUES item 48 carries the sweep.

     *    lone `i` into `I`, so this makes the pronoun space and capitalize together.
     *  - `it` - `a` (to), `e` (and), `i` (the, masculine plural), `o` (or). `è` (is) folds
     *    onto `e`.
     *  - `es` - `a` (to), `e` and `y` (and), `o` (or).
     *  - `pl` - `a`, `i` (and), `o` (about), `u` (at), `w` (in), `z` (with), and `e`, the
     *    interjection, added on a Polish speaker's report. No capture behind any of them:
     *    `w` and `z` are also common word starts, `e` is colloquial rather than a function
     *    word, so the set may want a longer delay. Unmeasured, and said so.
     *  - `cs` - conjunctions `a`, `i` and prepositions `k`, `o`, `s`, `u`, `v`, `z`.
     *    These are the one-letter function words listed by ÚJČ:
     *    https://prirucka.ujc.cas.cz/?id=880. Timing is unmeasured, as for Polish.
