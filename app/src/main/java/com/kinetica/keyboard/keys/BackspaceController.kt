/**
 * Backspace behaviors: tap deletes one char; holding past the arm delay
 * repeats char deletion at 50ms; sliding left STAGES one unit per threshold
 * crossed without deleting anything - the staged span is highlighted in a
 * preview chip and committed only at lift. Sliding back right retracts the
 * staged span unit by unit; lifting with nothing staged is a no-op, so a
 * slide too far is always recoverable.
 *
 * A unit is a whole word by default, or a single character when [charMode] is
 * set. Only the threshold and the meaning of the count change - the staging
 * protocol, the retraction and the lift semantics are shared, which is the whole
 * reason the mode is a flag here rather than a second gesture.
