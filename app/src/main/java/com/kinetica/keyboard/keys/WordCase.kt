/**
 * The case of a written word, as a thing that can be asked for.
 *
 * `ShiftState` already knows these three shapes but only as a consequence of taps: it
 * decides what the NEXT letter will look like and has no notion of re-casing text that
 * already exists. R34 asks for the other direction - the word is on screen and wrong, and
 * the user wants it in another case - so the map has to be nameable on its own, and it has
 * to be invertible, because the popup pre-selects the case the word is already in.
 *
 * Pure, and deliberately not a method on `ShiftState`: reading a state off text is not
 * something a tap machine should be able to do.
