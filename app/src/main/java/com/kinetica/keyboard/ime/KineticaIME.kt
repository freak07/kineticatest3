/**
 * True when a word typed entirely by tapping has earned an automatic space.
 *
 * A swipe-built word autospaces because the gesture is a complete statement of intent:
 * the finger lifted, the decode landed, the word is over. Tapping says nothing of the
 * kind - every letter looks exactly like the middle of a longer word - which is why an
 * all-tap word has never had a timer at all.
 *
 * [literalIsWord] is the only signal that carries any weight, and it is measured to be
 * necessary and far from sufficient. Over every capture, of the tap states whose letters
 * spell a real word, 57% were mid-word and the typing continued. The delay filters most
 * of that (the median gap while continuing a word is 168 ms) and roughly one fire in
 * five is still premature at the default 300 ms - a rate that barely improves at 800 ms.
 *
 * Two further gates were measured and rejected: a frequency floor removes good fires as
 * fast as bad ones, and requiring the top candidate to equal the literal removes 9% of
 * misfires while costing 6% of correct ones. The wordlist is OpenSubtitles-derived, so
 * `ke`, `wh` and `whe` are all real entries and no dictionary test can do better.
 *
 * What makes the remaining error affordable is not a better guess but a cheaper one -
 * see [retractsAutospace], which takes the space back when the next thing typed turns
 * out to be another letter of the same word. That mechanism was unobserved for three
 * captures and fired for the first time in the prose one, which is what unblocked the
 * length rule below.
 *
 * [literalIsStandaloneLetter] is that rule's replacement for a single letter, and the
 * length gate is why it has to be asked separately: `a` and `I` are words and were refused
 * outright, which cost a manual space on **12% of the words** in the first prose capture
 * (16 of 130). It cannot be a dictionary question, because every letter a-z is an entry in
 * every bundled list - `en` holds `l` at 126 518 and `t` at 72 881 - so
 * [StandaloneLetters] carries a curated per-language set instead.
 *
 * **What makes one letter affordable is the delay, not the list.** One letter is weaker
 * evidence than a word, so it waits longer: see [singleLetterDelayMs]. Swept over three
 * captures, 22 one-letter words against 28 word-starts whose first letter is also a word,
 * the plateau is 275-350 ms and 300 spaces 17 of the 22 at three premature fires - of which
 * one is the `dell'anno` case the joined branch already excludes and two are aborted
 * garbage buffers. **Zero premature fires on a real finished word**, and all three would be
 * retracted by the next letter anyway. KNOWN_ISSUES item 48.
 *
 * [carriesNoToken] is the other half of that, and it is what makes one delete enough.
 * Deleting the space reopens the word through [KineticaIME.reloadWordUnderCursor], which
 * re-seeds it as tap anchors, and that decode used to be indistinguishable here from a
 * freshly tapped one, so the timer armed again and put the space straight back. What tells
 * the two apart is that the reload has no gesture behind it.
 *
 * **Do not add a flag that outlives one decode.** A `refused` gate here once recorded that
 * the user had deleted an automatic space and held it until the word finalized. It was set
 * on one word and read by later, unrelated ones, and on the 1.0.5 capture it silenced two
 * correct spaces: the finished `carpet` after `car` + delete + `pet`, and a word freshly
 * swiped after a slide. `carriesNoToken` is scoped to a single decode, which is the scope
 * the question has. KNOWN_ISSUES item 46.
 *
 * [addressField] is the same report's root cause rather than its symptom, and it is the
 * gate that actually won `name@mail.com`: in an email or URL field no automatic space is
 * ever wanted, so none is armed and the delete is never needed. All the gates are read
 * here rather than at the call sites so the whole decision stays in one testable place.

 * `Key.isLetter` requires `a`..`z`, so the key never enters the gesture engine and a tap on
 * it routes to `onPunctuation`, which FINALIZES the pending word. `d'accordo` therefore
 * reaches the composer as `d` and then `accordo`, and `don't` as `don` and then a one-letter
 * `t` that the length rule blocks outright. So no word containing an apostrophe has ever
 * autospaced, in any language.
 *
 * Reading the token back out of the editor is what makes the question answerable without
 * touching the geometry: `don't`, `it's` and `can't` are in `en_wordlist` with large counts,
 * so they are words and they space. `log-12.com` and `example.com` are not - `Alphabet.encode`
 * rejects digits outright - so they stay refused, which is the behaviour the report asked to
 * keep.
 *
 * **Italian elision is not reached by this lookup, and the reason is data, not logic.**
 * `it_wordlist.txt` holds ten apostrophe entries in total and every one is corpus junk
 * (`e'o`, `e'a`, `n'roll`); `d'accordo` and `l'altro` are absent, so no dictionary
 * test can find them here. [autospacesTappedWord] therefore does not rely on this lookup
 * for them: when the joiner is an apostrophe and the joined token is not a word, it judges
 * the piece after the apostrophe on its own. Generating the elided forms is still worth
 * doing - it is what would let an elided word be DECODED as one gesture - but the space no
