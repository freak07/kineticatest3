     * Declared by the layout JSON rather than inferred from [locale], because
     * the fact is about the alternates an author chose and not about the code:
     * the English layout carries eight accented forms on "a" and needs none of
     * them, while a future language layout exists precisely to carry its own.
     * Absent means false, which is also the right answer for the plain "qwerty"
     * fallback any unregistered language is served.
     *
     * Read only by [LayoutMutations.withoutForeignAlternates]; the swipe engine
     * never sees alternates at all.
