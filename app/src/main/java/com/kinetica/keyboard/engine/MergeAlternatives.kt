     * The generators used to append into one shared list, each returning as soon
     * as MAX_ALT_SEQUENCES was reached. That made two different outcomes
     * indistinguishable in a capture: a generator that examined every candidate
     * cut and rejected them all, and a generator that was never reached at all.
     * They are not the same defect and only one of them is fixable by tuning.
     *
     * Each generator now builds its own list and the budget is spent by
     * concatenating them in the same order as before, so the sequences produced
     * are byte-identical to the shared-list form - verified by replaying the
     * 2026-08-28 capture's 933 decodes, empty count 191 either way, and by the
     * golden suite. What is new is the accounting: taken/produced per generator,
     * and what the cap refused.
     *
     * That accounting is what the capture was missing. Of the 186 cross-stream
     * taps landing inside a swipe later than SPLIT_MARGIN_MS - every one of which
     * the mid-swipe split is obliged to examine, since no guard below it can skip
     * one - 89 were never examined, and with two swipes each carrying an interior
     * tap it produced nothing on 11 of 11 buffers.
     *
     * **Reallocating the budget was then measured and does not pay for itself**,
     * so the order here is deliberately unchanged: KNOWN_ISSUES item 41 records
     * the equal round robin, the per-generator ceiling and the reservation, each
     * of which buys two or three multi-swipe buffers and loses four to seven
     * swipes-only ones. The readings the starved generator would have built are
     * mostly refused downstream by the segment gates instead, which is where the
     * next work is.
