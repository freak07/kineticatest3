         *    into the first visit reads as an out-and-back and every run splits.
         *  - the split is tested BEFORE the new-minimum update, or a visit that
         *    ends on the run's deepest sample (exactly "vedere"'s final e)
         *    swallows the pass before it.
         *

         * argmin is also the argmin of whichever sub-run contains it - so this
