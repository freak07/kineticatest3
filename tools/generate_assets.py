  app/src/main/assets/dictionaries/<lang>_bigrams.txt    (w1 TAB w2 TAB freq)

Primary sources (downloaded):
  - hermitdave/FrequencyWords <lang>_50k.txt (MIT) - unigram frequencies from
    OpenSubtitles 2018. Realistic conversational frequencies, which matter for
    swipe disambiguation ("their" vs "there" is decided mostly by frequency).
  - Bigrams (all languages): counted from the Tatoeba per-language sentence
    corpus (CC BY 2.0 FR, attribution "tatoeba.org"), which matches the
    conversational register of the OpenSubtitles unigrams. English previously
    used Peter Norvig's count_2w.txt, but that data derives from the
    LDC-distributed Google Web Trillion Word Corpus and carries no explicit
    redistribution license, so it cannot be bundled in a public release.

Bigrams are filtered to the unigram vocabulary so every bigram endpoint
resolves to a trie word id at load time.

Offline fallback (English only): /usr/share/dict/words with synthetic Zipf
frequencies. Zipf ranks are alphabetical-order-free (hash-shuffled) so the
fallback does not systematically favor early alphabet words.

# Straight apostrophe U+0027 only (Alphabet.encode drops the curly one).
# Stripped forms that are themselves common standalone words (well/we'll,
# ill/I'll, id/I'd, wed/we'd) are deliberately excluded so the real word is
