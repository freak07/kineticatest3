An open-source (GPL-3.0) Android keyboard (IME) built around **two-handed
hybrid swipe/tap input**: each thumb can independently swipe or tap,
simultaneously, and both gesture streams merge into a single word prediction.
It is a spiritual successor to the discontinued Nintype (also known as
Keyboard69), built from first principles on Android's public IME APIs - no
forks, no third-party gesture libraries.

**Private by construction: the app declares zero network permission, so
nothing you type can ever leave your device.** All decoding, prediction, and
learning run locally; the personal dictionary is on-device storage only, and
password/private fields disable suggestions, trails, and learning entirely.

Example - typing SOMETHING:

- Left thumb taps `S`, then `E`
- Right thumb swipes `O -> M`, then `T -> H -> I -> N -> G`, overlapping in time
- Kinetica merges `S + OM + E + THING -> "something"`

## Install

[<img src="https://f-droid.org/badge/get-it-on.png" alt="Get it on F-Droid" height="80">](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.kinetica.keyboard/)

F-Droid is the recommended channel: it updates in the background and verifies
the build for you. New versions reach it a few days after a release is tagged
here.

Or take `kinetica-<version>.apk` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/EZ-eta/kinetica/releases/latest):

```bash
adb install -r kinetica-*.apk
```

Either way, open the Kinetica icon afterwards and follow the three enable steps.
If you have been running a debug build, uninstall it first - it carries a
different signing key, so Android will refuse the upgrade. Export your personal
dictionary (Settings > Dictionary) before you do.

Release APKs are signed with the project's own key by the tagged
[release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml), so the build behind any given
APK is public and inspectable. Kinetica ships to F-Droid as a
[reproducible build](https://f-droid.org/docs/Reproducible_Builds): F-Droid
rebuilds the tag on its own servers, verifies its output against the APK above,
and publishes that same signature. The two channels therefore carry the same
bytes, and either can install and update over the other's build.

## Features

- Dual-pointer gesture tracking: two independent swipe/tap streams, merged by
  timestamp with bounded ambiguity handling (near-simultaneous order swaps,
  mid-swipe cross-thumb taps for explicit double letters)
- From-scratch swipe decoding: banded dynamic time warping over
  arc-length-resampled paths, an anchored segmental trie search, frequency and
  bigram-context scoring
- Six languages bundled, not six supported: the trie, DTW matcher, merge and
  scoring are locale- and layout-independent, so a language is data plus
  registration - a wordlist, a layout, and the entries listed in
  [ADDING_A_LANGUAGE.md](ADDING_A_LANGUAGE.md). Polish arrived that way, as a
  contributor's pull request. The matching alphabet is a-z plus apostrophe and
  accented Latin letters fold onto it, so Latin scripts fit; a non-Latin script
  is a major engine change and out of scope.
- What ships: 46k-word English plus 49k-word Italian, Spanish, Polish, Czech and
  German dictionaries with real corpus frequencies; 40k–100k bigrams per language;
  switch languages in Settings without restarting the IME. Accented words
  (perché, città, señal, también, dziękuję, późno, přítel, město, groß) are matched
  through their base-key gesture path and restored with accents on commit.
- Tap autocorrect (adjacent-key substitutions and transpositions) with three
  aggressiveness levels; it also restores missing accents
  (perche -> perché, pozno -> późno, mesto -> město, gross -> groß)
- Suggestion bar of 3-5 equal-width, independently tappable candidate zones,
  best first (bold), with flick-up fast commit; up to 10 candidates are kept
  and a leftward swipe starting at the bar's right edge cycles to the next
  page of five (position dots at the bottom center). After a commit the same
  bar becomes the correction strip: the committed word is highlighted and
  tapping any other zone (including the literal tap string after an
  autocorrect) replaces it directly - and takes back the personal weight the
  unwanted commit earned; the correction strip pages with the same gesture
- Live tap completions: a partially tapped word surfaces its dictionary
  extensions as pickable suggestions mid-word (t-h offers "the"/"they"), and
  the exact letters you typed are always the last tappable zone, so an
  out-of-dictionary word commits verbatim with one tap. Completions are
  pick-only by design: space never autocorrects onto a completion
- Editing into a committed word reloads it: backspacing to the end of a word
  re-seeds the predictor with its remaining letters, so continued taps or
  swipes correct that word instead of starting a fragment, and the eventual
  commit earns personal weight for the whole word
- Adaptive personal weighting, partitioned per language: every committed word
  earns personal weight that boosts its future ranking (a consistently chosen
  "thou" eventually outranks "you"); long-press a suggestion to reinforce it
  manually (configurable boost), then slide up while holding to boost further
  or slide down to take weight away, with the badge previewing the pending
  tier live and the change applying on lift; reinforced words show a tiered
  badge (up to 7 dots in a hexagon pattern) in the bar
- Long-press alternates on every letter and punctuation key: accents first,
  digits/symbols last (a Settings toggle flips that priority); hold past the
  long-press delay for a popup, slide sideways to choose, lift to commit; a
  plain long-press commits the first alternate; the default alternate is
  hinted in the key's top-right corner at 40% opacity
- Swipe trails with per-key hue cycling, key-contact bursts, press highlights
- Special keys: spacebar slide moves the cursor; backspace hold repeats;
  backspace slide-left stages whole words for deletion reversibly - the
  staged span shows struck-through in a preview chip, sliding back retracts
  it, and only lifting commits the delete (lift at zero = no-op)
- Customizable edge swipes (Settings > Edge swipe shortcuts): any key +
  direction can insert text or open the emoji picker; defaults are
  backspace-up `!`, enter-up `?`, V-down `,`, B-down `.`, X-down emoji
- Two-page symbols layer (currency, math, brackets on page 2, `=\<` and
  `?123` keys switch pages with a 1/2 indicator) plus a phone-style numpad
  (`?123` tap / slide-right; slide-left on enter returns to letters;
  re-entering symbols always lands on page 1)
- Settings from the keyboard: hold `?123` and slide onto the gear
- Chord shortcuts: hold `?123` and tap a letter to insert its expansion
  (managed in Settings; default is zero chords, fully opt-in per letter)
- Multilingual mid-typing: an ordered set of enabled languages, cycled by a
  chord (hold `?123` + tap the configured letter, default L) without leaving
  the current field; with several languages enabled the active language code
  shows at the spacebar's bottom-center; an experimental "auto-detect
  language per word" toggle (default off) mixes the active language with the
  first enabled non-active language and prefers that other language only when
  it is clearly more confident
- Contraction/elision writing: English contractions ("don't", "aren't",
  "here's" ...) are in the dictionary and decode straight from the
  apostrophe-free letters (the engine inserts the dictionary apostrophe for
  free); an optional apostrophe key (Settings, off by default) adds a tappable
  "'" right of "L" for writing any elided or contracted word ("nell'immagine",
  "don't") without the symbols layer
- Peck-type mode (Settings toggle or a configurable `?123`-chord): disables
  swipe decoding, suggestions and autocorrect entirely so every tap inserts
  its letter exactly - for slang and out-of-dictionary text the engine keeps
  mangling; the spacebar shows TAP while active
- Configurable comma key (Settings): keep it, remove it (the spacebar widens
  to absorb its slot), or repurpose it as a custom character, a short text,
  or an editor action (paste / select all); a repurposed key keeps "," as its
  first long-press alternate
- Emoji: a Settings toggle (default off) makes the picker the first
  long-press option on the comma key; X-key swipe-down always opens the
  category-tabbed picker regardless of the toggle. A "frequently used" tab
  leads the strip once there is something in it, ordered by how often each
  emoji is picked rather than by recency - one sent daily outranks one sent
  once yesterday - and it is hidden until then. Picks in a password field are
  never recorded
- Dictionary management (Settings > Dictionary): per-language base and
  personal dictionary info; on-device import of an AOSP-format
  `wordlist.combined` merged against the bundled wordlist (no Python
  needed); export/import of the personal dictionary as JSON; reset of the
  personal dictionary per language
- Theming: bundled dark theme, Android 12+ Material You wallpaper colors, or
  a full palette derived from one custom primary color; trail color can
  follow the theme accent
- Five layout modes: full, right-aligned, left-aligned, split, one-handed
- Adjustable height (drag the handle above the suggestion bar, or Settings);
  the handle's own height is a 0-20dp setting applied live, and zero removes it
  and reclaims the strip
- Autospace after swiped words with configurable delay and spacebar indicator.
  Optionally after tapped words too, including words with an apostrophe (`don't`,
  `dell'anno`) and single letters (`a`, `I`); a space that arrives early is taken
  back by the next letter, and one you delete does not come back
- Zen mode: disables all animation work for battery/GPU savings
- On-device learning: every committed word (and any unknown word) feeds a
  private user dictionary that merges into predictions
- Privacy: **zero network permission**; password fields disable suggestions,
  trails, and learning

## Worth a look in Settings

Most of what people have asked for since the first release was already in
Settings and simply hard to find. The ones that come up most:

- **Chord shortcuts that paste, copy, cut, select all or retype the word.**
  Settings > Chords, add a chord and set *This chord* to the action you want.
  Hold `?123` and tap that letter to fire it. Chords still type text too - a
  signature, an email address. The same screen holds the language-switch and
  peck-type keys, and *Chord lead-in* sets how long `?123` must be held first.
- **Long-press popups without the accents.** *Hide accented letters on
  long-press* leaves only digits and symbols, so `A` gives you `@` instead of
  eight forms of `a` you will never type. Ignored for Italian, Spanish, Polish, Czech
  and German, whose own alphabets need theirs. If you would rather keep the accents
  but reach the digits first, *Prioritize numbers over accents on long-press* does that
  instead.
- **A shorter keyboard.** *Keyboard height* goes down to 10% of the screen.
  *Suggestion bar height* shrinks the strip above it - the word text scales with
  it - and *Resize handle height* takes the grip strip from 20dp down to 0,
  which reclaims it entirely. It applies as you drag, without the keyboard
  being torn down and rebuilt.
- **Light theme and your own colour.** *Light or dark* (or follow the system),
  and *Accent hue* is a slider with a preview of the palette underneath it, so
  you can see the change without leaving Settings.
- **Your own period and comma symbols.** *Period long-press symbols* and *Comma
  long-press symbols* take a space-separated list; leave either blank to keep the
  built-in one.
- **Move the cursor without arrow keys.** Slide sideways along the spacebar. No
  setting, it is always on.
- **Push a word up or down the suggestions.** Long-press a suggestion and slide
  up to prefer it, down to demote it. *Reinforce increment* sets the step size,
  and Settings > Dictionary > *Review learned words* lists everything Kinetica
  has picked up, with a search box and per-word delete.
- **Get rid of a word for good.** Sliding a suggestion down only lowers its
  priority; it can still come back. Settings > Dictionary > *Blocked words* takes
  a spelling and drops it out of the dictionary altogether, so it stops being
  offered at all. The dialog stays open after each one, since blocking several in
  a row is the usual case, and tapping a word already in the list lifts the block.
  Per language, and it takes effect on the next word you type.
- **Automatic spaces while tapping, not only while swiping.** *Autospace tapped
  words too* is off by default, because tapping says less about whether a word is
  over than a finished gesture does: every letter looks like the middle of a longer
  word. With it on, a word your dictionary holds gets its space after a pause, and
  the next letter you type takes the space back if the word was not over after all.
  Words with an apostrophe are read as one token, so `don't` and `dell'anno` space
  correctly, and single letters that are words on their own (`a` and `I` in English,
  `a`, `e`, `i`, `o` in Italian) wait a little longer than a whole word does before
  spacing. Three sliders set the delays: one for swipes, one for taps, one for how
  long a space stays retractable.
- **A retype button.** *Retype button on the suggestion bar* reserves the bar's
  right edge for a small restart arrow. One tap throws away the word you are
  writing, or the one just finished, so a gesture that came out wrong can be redone
  in place without hunting for the delete key.
- **The spacebar's cursor slide, faster or by word.** Sliding along the spacebar
  moves the cursor; *Spacebar slide distance* sets how far you travel per step, and
  *Spacebar slide moves by word* steps a whole word at a time the way the backspace
  slide does.
- **A much bigger dictionary.** Settings > Dictionary > *Import improved
  dictionary* takes an AOSP `wordlist.combined` and merges it with the bundled
  list - three to five times the words. Grab one from
  [aosp-dictionaries](https://codeberg.org/Helium314/aosp-dictionaries) under
  `wordlists/` (the `.combined` files, not the compiled `.dict` ones); Polish
  and Czech users should choose `main_pl.combined` and `main_cs.combined`,
  respectively.
- **When a word refuses to come out right.** *Peck-type mode* turns off swiping,
  suggestions and autocorrect so every tap inserts exactly its letter. Good for
  slang, codes and passwords the dictionary keeps fighting.
- **Repurpose the comma key.** *Comma key* can become Paste or Select all, or a
  character or short phrase of your own; the comma stays in its long-press popup.

## Requirements

- JDK 17
- Android SDK: platform 34, build-tools 34.0.0 (command-line tools suffice)
- Gradle 8.7 via the bundled wrapper (no Gradle install needed)
- minSdk 26 (Android 8.0), targetSdk 34

### Toolchain from zero (macOS, Homebrew)

```bash
brew install openjdk@17
brew install --cask android-commandlinetools
export JAVA_HOME="$(brew --prefix openjdk@17)/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home"
export ANDROID_HOME="$(brew --prefix)/share/android-commandlinetools"
yes | sdkmanager --sdk_root="$ANDROID_HOME" --licenses
sdkmanager --sdk_root="$ANDROID_HOME" "platform-tools" "platforms;android-34" "build-tools;34.0.0"
echo "sdk.dir=$ANDROID_HOME" > local.properties
```

On Linux or Windows any JDK 17 plus the Android command-line tools work the
same way: install SDK platform 34 and build-tools 34.0.0, then point
`sdk.dir` in `local.properties` (or `ANDROID_HOME`) at the SDK root.

## Build and install

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### Release build

Release APKs are signed with a local keystore that never enters version
control. One-time setup:

```bash
mkdir -p keystore
keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore keystore/kinetica-release.keystore \
  -alias kinetica -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
cat > keystore.properties <<EOF
storeFile=keystore/kinetica-release.keystore
storePassword=<your store password>
keyAlias=kinetica
keyPassword=<your key password>
EOF
```

Then:

```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

Without `keystore.properties`, `assembleRelease` still builds and produces an
unsigned APK (not installable until signed).

Run the unit tests (the whole prediction engine is pure Kotlin and tested on
the JVM, including golden decodes against the real dictionary):

```bash
./gradlew test
```

### Enabling the keyboard

Open the Kinetica launcher icon and follow the three steps: enable Kinetica in
the system keyboard list, select it as the current keyboard, then try the test
field. Settings are reachable from the same screen or from the system IME
settings entry.

## Architecture

```
MotionEvent
   -> KeyboardView          touch routing: letters -> engine, space/backspace -> controllers
   -> GestureEngine         <=2 pointer streams tracked by pointerId, tap/swipe classified at lift
   -> InputToken            TapToken (anchor) | SwipeToken (resampled path + key contacts)
   -> WordComposer          token buffer per word, decode snapshots on a dedicated thread
   -> WordPredictor         merge alternatives -> anchored segmental trie search -> DTW -> top 5
   -> KineticaIME           commit-only text model via InputConnection, suggestions, autocorrect
```

Source layout (package `com.kinetica.keyboard`):

| Package | Contents |
|---|---|
| `engine/` | Pure-Kotlin core: `GestureEngine`, `GestureStream`, `DtwMatcher`, `Trie`, `WordPredictor`, `WordComposer`, `BigramTable`, `MergeAlternatives`, `AccentFolder`, `DictionaryLoader`, `DictionaryMerger`, models |
| `ime/` | `KineticaIME` (InputMethodService), `InputConnectionHelper`, `EditorState` |
| `ui/` | `KeyboardView`, `SuggestionBarView`, `InputContainerView`, `EmojiPickerView`, `KeyboardTheme`, `TrailRenderer`, `BurstRenderer` |
| `layout/` | JSON layout model, loader, mutations (emoji on comma, number priority), the five layout-mode transforms |
| `keys/` | `ShiftState`, spacebar/backspace controllers, `EdgeSwipeDetector`, `EdgeSwipeBindings` |
| `settings/` | `SettingsActivity`, `ChordSettingsActivity`, `EdgeSwipeSettingsActivity`, `DictionarySettingsActivity`, preference fragment, `Prefs`, `KeyboardConfig` |
| `data/` | Room database: user dictionary (personal weights, per language), chord shortcuts; `DictionaryStore` for imported wordlists |
| `onboarding/` | Launcher activity with the enable flow |

### Algorithm notes

- **Coordinates** are key-width units (px / key width): density-, height- and
  layout-mode-independent.
- **Swipe matching**: observed paths and ideal word paths (polylines through
  key centers, consecutive duplicates removed) are resampled to 32 points at
  uniform arc length, then compared with Sakoe-Chiba banded DTW (radius 4,
  endpoint-anchored and endpoint-weighted, early-abandoning against the
  current top-5 score floor).
- **Candidate generation**: DFS over a flat-array trie (2 ints per node,
  children contiguous and letter-sorted; ~1.4 MB for 46k words). Taps are
  exact anchors; swipes are segments pruned by start/end key neighborhoods,
  near-path membership, path-order monotonicity, and an ideal-path length
  band. Each letter records one resample index per distinct pass of the path
  within its radius (not a single global nearest index), so revisited letters
  (the second e of "however") and keys the path merely flies over cannot
  break the monotonicity prune. DTW runs only on complete surviving words.
- **Dual-stream merge**: tokens sort by gesture start time. Cross-stream
  tokens starting within 120 ms also try the swapped order; a tap landing
  inside the other thumb's swipe also tries a split of that swipe around the
  tap (this is how a cross-thumb tap doubles a letter: `h-e-l-o` swipe + `l`
  tap decodes as `hel + l + o` = hello).
- **Scoring**: `frequency_weight * geometric_term(d) * bigram_multiplier *
  personal_boost`, where `geometric_term(d) = 1 / (1 + min(d, 0.50))^3.75`
  saturates: inside half a key width the shape of your gesture is informative
  and is scored steeply, and past that a d=0.6 match and a d=1.5 match are both
  "this is not the shape you drew", so frequency decides between them. Both
  multipliers are then weighted by the fit of the candidate they apply to -
  full strength inside the saturation cap, fading to nothing one whole key
  width out - so a frequent or heavily reinforced word cannot out-argue a
  clearly better-fitting one. Frequencies are log-quantized from the corpus and
  bigram boosts are normalized per preceding word.
- **Accents**: the trie stores accent-folded keys (a-z + apostrophe); nodes
  whose spelling differs from the folded key, or that several spellings share
  ("senti"/"sentì"), carry per-variant display forms with their own
  frequencies, emitted as separate candidates.
- Decode latency budget is < 100 ms from pointer lift; measured single-digit
  milliseconds on the full dictionary (see `RealDictionaryTest`).
- **Reversible backspace slide**: the staged-deletion preview is drawn inside
  the IME's own window (a chip above the backspace key showing the span
  struck-through), NOT via `setComposingRegion` on the editor. Kinetica's
  text model is deliberately commit-only, and composing-region styling is
  unreliable across apps (some editors drop or restyle composing spans;
  autocomplete fields react to composition changes as if the user typed).
  The trade-off: the highlight appears above the keyboard, not inside the
  text field itself, but it renders identically in every app. In password
  fields the preview shows bullets, never the actual characters.

## Data sources

Regenerate the bundled dictionaries with `python3 tools/generate_assets.py
--lang en|it|es|pl|cs|de` (add `--dry-run` to preview):

- Word frequencies (all languages):
  [hermitdave/FrequencyWords](https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords)
  `en_50k` / `it_50k` / `es_50k` / `pl_50k` / `cs_50k` / `de_50k`
  (OpenSubtitles2018), MIT License.
- Bigrams (all languages): counted from the [Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org)
  per-language sentence corpora (`eng_sentences.tsv` ~2.03M sentences,
  `ita_sentences.tsv` ~975k, `spa_sentences.tsv` ~441k,
  `pol_sentences.tsv` ~137k, `ces_sentences.tsv` ~90, `deu_sentences.tsv`),
  licensed[CC BY 2.0 FR](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/fr/),
  attribution: tatoeba.org. Conversational register, which matches the
  OpenSubtitles-derived unigrams. (English previously used Peter Norvig's
  `count_2w.txt`; that data derives from the LDC-distributed Google Web
  Trillion Word Corpus and carries no explicit redistribution license, so it
  was regenerated from Tatoeba before the public release.)
- Emoji data: hand-curated `assets/emoji_data.json` (478 plain Unicode emoji
  with names and search keywords, through Unicode 15); no external dataset. ZWJ
  sequences are deliberately excluded, which is also why Unicode 15.1 is absent:
  a device that cannot render one draws its parts, which is worse than a tofu
  box. The picker checks each entry against the device font at load, so an emoji
  this Android version cannot draw is left out rather than shown as tofu.

### Open keyboard dictionaries: licensing survey

Considered as higher-quality replacements for the OpenSubtitles-derived
wordlists (July 2026):

| Project | Code license | Dictionary data | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| [HeliBoard](https://github.com/Helium314/HeliBoard) | Apache-2.0 | [Helium314/aosp-dictionaries](https://codeberg.org/Helium314/aosp-dictionaries) (repo LICENSE: GPL-3.0); the `main_*` wordlists are AOSP LatinIME dictionaries (Apache-2.0 at origin) mirrored via OpenBoard; experimental lists CC BY 4.0 | Cleanest import path: raw `wordlist.combined` format with per-word `f=0..255` log frequency, `flags` (abbreviation, possibly_offensive) and per-word next-word bigram ranks; `main_en_US`, `main_it`, `main_pl`,`main_cs`, and `main_de` exist |
| [FUTO Keyboard](https://github.com/futo-org/android-keyboard) | FUTO Source First 1.1 (non-commercial redistribution limits, not OSI-open) | Same restrictive terms apply to repo contents | Rejected: incompatible with open redistribution |
| [FlorisBoard](https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard) | Apache-2.0 | Ships no frequency wordlists usable for import | Nothing to import |

`tools/generate_assets.py --merge-aosp <wordlist.combined>` can merge an
AOSP-derived list into the primary wordlist (frequencies are de-quantized
onto the raw-count scale, abbreviation/offensive entries dropped). The same
merge now also runs on-device: Settings > Dictionary > "Import improved
dictionary" accepts a user-supplied `wordlist.combined` through the system
file picker (`DictionaryMerger` is a Kotlin port of the Python logic), writes
the merged list to app-internal storage, and loads it instead of the bundled
asset; "Remove imported dictionary" reverts. The bundled assets intentionally
remain pure OpenSubtitles/Tatoeba until a merged dictionary has been
validated on-device against the golden decode tests. Attribution for an AOSP
merge is Apache-2.0 (retain the license notice; this section serves as that
notice).

### Adaptive personal weighting

`personal_boost = 1 + 0.15 * ln(1 + personal_count)`, applied to the score
above and weighted by the candidate's own geometric fit like every other
multiplier.

Every final commit increments the word's personal count (Room-persisted per
language - counts never mix across languages - capped at the top 5000
words at load). Correcting a commit through the suggestion bar transfers the
weight: the replacement earns the count and the replaced word gives its back.
The constants: the frequency-weight gap between a top-frequency word and a
mid-frequency rival is ~1.4x, so 20 commits (`1 + 0.15*ln(21) = 1.46`) flip
such a ranking, 5 commits produce a visible climb, and the logarithm keeps
any single word from swallowing the strip (bigram context tops out at 2.5x
and stays competitive). Because the boost is weighted by the candidate's own
fit, a heavily reinforced word can show a full badge and still not take a
gesture it does not match - reinforcement buys ranking among plausible words,
not against geometry. Long-pressing a suggestion adds a configurable boost
(+1/+5/+10) immediately. Reinforced words show a tiered badge of up to 7
dots (1 center + 6 hexagon corners); tier thresholds double per level
(counts 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64), so early uses advance visibly, tier 7 lands
at 64 uses, and equal visual steps match the ln-shaped ranking boost - a +10
manual boost jumps several tiers at once by construction. Learned counts also
merge into the trie at load (`count * 1000` against raw corpus counts) so
out-of-vocabulary words become first-class candidates.

### A note on the name and icon

Kinetica is the name I use for this project, and the launcher icon is my own
artwork. The GPL covers the code, and forks are genuinely welcome - please
rebrand them. Use a different app name and a different icon so users can tell
your build from mine, and so bug reports and reviews land in the right place.

No trademark is registered and none is being asserted; this is a request for
clarity, not a legal restriction. The code itself is yours to use under the
GPL, name aside.

## Support

If Kinetica is useful to you, you can [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/ez_eta).

Entirely optional. The app is and stays free, declares no network permission,
shows no ads, and will never ask you for anything at runtime.
